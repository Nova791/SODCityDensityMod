# SODCityDensityMod
A simple mod for Shadows of Doubt to change the default density of each block when generating a city
This is a simple mod, that allows the user to change the default Density of the whole city. This can be used to make short sprawling cities, or more dense smaller cities with higher buildings.

Installation:
Install the most recent BepInEx into Shadow of Doubt
Unzip the DensityMod folder into the plugins folder in BepInEx
Start the game

By default, the mod sets all density to "low". You can change this in the config file found in BepInEx -> configs. 
The options available are: "low", "medium". "high", "veryHigh", and "vanilla"(incase you want normal generation back)

Using the setting "low" on seed "Seoul.0.3317.kF03wFhI4rWqAM3M" with 7x7 blocks
The population was 591

Using the setting "veryHigh" on the same settings
The population was 1133
